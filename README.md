## About

Well, first off, let me just say a heart friendly Hello to all of you who drop by my repo. It is here that I will upload all my attempts to code a Timezone Conversion Tool (Backend and Frontend). 
I'll separate the two solutions each into its own folder. I'll also document my progress and the problems I've encountered thus far.

## Reasoning

I've encountered a client on Upwork that wanted me to design and architect a solution of my own choosing in Haskell and preferably another functional language as frontend. I've quickly decided for Elm since I've worked with it in the past.
Also, by being functional in both ends, it's kind of nice to see how we can reuse types and how each of the two languages employs serialization.
The idea behind the project was that it offers plenty of opportunity for problem solving, tweaking and it's a pretty neat way to discover FP through this task. It's not too simple yet hopefully not too complicated.

So, please bear with me.

## Haskell

I've only just started thinking about the types in Haskell. This is an important step since they will be inter-usable and in FP the first and foremost problem is identifying good and solid types.
